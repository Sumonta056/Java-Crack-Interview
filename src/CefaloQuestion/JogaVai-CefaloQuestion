Need to Construct an Interface named “CefaloQuestion.Input” which
will have two methods . One method will concat characters and another
method will print the buffer . Two classes named “inputChar” and
“inputNumercial” need to be constructed . Classes Will override the
Methods of “input” interface . class “inputChar” will take all characters
as input but will add all characters to the string buffer. Class
“inputNumerical” will also take all characters as input but will add only
numeric characters to the string buffer.
